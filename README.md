# RayTracer
![screenshot 1](Build/Assets/shot1.png)
Created for my Computer Graphics class. This program is able to render simple spheres with their own textures using a ray-tracing pipeline.
## Features
* Capable of rendering simple objects using Lambertian, metallic, and emissive materials.
* Implements ambient occlusion and multiple bounce reflections for added realism.
